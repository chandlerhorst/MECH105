# MECH105
Hello! I am Chandler Horst, a student that is taking/did take MECH105 in the Spring 2017-2018 year at Colorado State University. The class was titled 'Numerical Methods' and that is exactly what is included in this repository. In it, we have
- Simpson's Method algorithm
- False Position algorithm
- LU factorization algorithm

Most of the algorithms work, but bugs do exist within the code. I have highlighted what does work and what does not work. Feel free to suggest contributions if you care enough.

Peek around, find something you like.
