# MECH105
Hello! I am Chandler Horst, a student that took MECH105, numerical methods, in the Spring 2017-2018 year. The class was titled 'Numerical Methods' and that is exactly what is included in this repository. In it, we have
- Simpson's Method algorithm
- False Position algorithm
- LU factorization algorithm

Most of the algorithms work, but bugs do exist within the code. I have highlighted what does work and what does not work. Feel free to suggest contributions.

Peek around, find something you like.
